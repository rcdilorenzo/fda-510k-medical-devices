## What kind of devices are considered safe?

With just over 148,000 records in this dataset, a wide variety of medical devices are included since the 510(k) clearance began in 1976. Perhaps one of the most important questions to consider is the review decision based on the type of medical device. After a bit of analysis, it appears that the FDA has a particular review committee for eah of the general categories of devices since less than a 1% difference exists between the committee decisions and the categorization of the device.
