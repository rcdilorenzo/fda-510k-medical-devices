## How long do most reviews take?

As submissions are required to be made at least 90 days before their intended marketing, the review time in days is a particularly valuable metric to visualize. As seen below, close to two-thirds of the review times by year are above that minimum requirement. Although the introduction of the [FDA document](https://l.rcd.zone/fda-510k-dataset) states that most reviews are finished within 90 days, the data below suggests that nearly every year since 2005 has taken longer than that on average. Because devices cannot be marked before the review is complete, it would be wiser based on the data to submit at least 150 days before the target market date in order to avoid delay.
