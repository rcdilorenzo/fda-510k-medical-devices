# Process

As with most journeys, mine began by searching the internet. This quest, however, was not for memes or cat videos but for a real dataset that I could manipulate using data science and programming tools. Once I discovered the data from [open.fda.gov](https://open.fda.gov/), I became interested in the [device clearances dataset](https://open.fda.gov/device/510k/reference/) since it was one of the larger ones available (about ~ 1 GB uncompressed). From here, I began a multi-stage process following this outline:

0. [Importing Data](#importing-data)
0. [Data Exploration](#data-exploration)
0. [Setup Business Goals](#setup-business-goals)
0. [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)
0. [Data Presentation](#data-presentation)

## Importing Data

Although an API was directly available from the FDA, it was unsuitable for my purposes since I needed to quickly run complex queries that would be impossible through the API. Additionally, I needed to use some data science related tools for the class, thereby making this decision easy. With my software engineering background, I was quite familiar with the JSON format but even at the beginning had an inkling that a fully-formated JSON block might be difficult to import into "Big Data" tools.

At this point, the JSON looked something like this:

```json
{"key": "value"}
```

## Setup Business Goals

## Data Analysis
