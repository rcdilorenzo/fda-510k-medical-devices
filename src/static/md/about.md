# What is this website all about?

What is this anyways? This interactive website is an exploration that I have done as part of my coursework at [Regis University](http://www.regis.edu/). It is not intended to be authoritative or without mistakes though I have done my best to ensure its accuracy. The code for this website including the dynamic graphs were originally put together within a week by myself. I did have a bit of design help for a few of the fonts and colors from a kind co-worker with actual design skills. This application was built using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [ChartJS](http://www.chartjs.org/), and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/guide). Check out the *Process* tab above for more details about the technical side.


# Who Am I?

Greetings. My name is Christian Di Lorenzo as you may have already gathered. I am finishing up my B.S. in Computer Science by the end of 2017 and have already started my [M.S. in Data Science at Regis University](http://www.regis.edu/CCIS/Academics/Degrees-Programs/Graduate-Programs/MS-Data-Science.aspx) remotely from North Carolina as of Fall 2017. I am a firm believer in Jesus Christ and love crafting helpful tools for humans using technology. I am employed as a software engineer at a local company [RoleModel Software](https://www.rolemodelsoftware.com/). In terms of technology, I primarily do native iOS development along with front and back-end web development in a number of languages and frameworks. 

For more information, I can be found in a number of places [Medium](https://l.rcd.zone/md-prof), [StackOverflow](https://l.rcd.zone/so-profile), [GitHub](https://l.rcd.zone/github-prof), [YouTube](https://l.rcd.zone/yt-profile), [Keybase.io](https://l.rcd.zone/keybase-profile).
