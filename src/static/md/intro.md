# Introduction

Since 1976, medical devices designated a Class I, II, or III type for human applications have been required to undergo a 510(k) application to the FDA to determine safety. The purpose of this requirement is to verify that the new device is at least as safe and effective as existing legal products on the market. This submission is mandatory at least 90 days in advance of its marketing.

To more fully understand the 510(k) submissions to the FDA, a number of questions will be examined using various vizualizations. See the process section above for a more detailed, technical background on how the analysis was performed.

1. What kind of devices tend to get approved?
2. What are the demographics of the type of devices submitted?
3. What type of review committees tend to approve devices?
4. Is there any correlation between time of year and approval percentage?
5. Where do most submissions come from geographically?
6. How often do reviews get expedited?
7. What can be gathered from the free-text summary statements of the reviews?
