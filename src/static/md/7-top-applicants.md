## What companies make the most submissions?

Because of personal unfamiliarity, I cannot speak to the significance of any particular applicant in this top twenty list. However, at a minimum, the fact that Abbott Laboratories has submitted over 850 medical device applications and others that have multiple hundred reviews likely indicates that nature of their business. Future investigation for a specific company might benefit from this data as a company metric.
